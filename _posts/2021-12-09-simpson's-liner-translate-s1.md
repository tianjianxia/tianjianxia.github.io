title: Simpson's Season 1 Liner Translate
tags: [linguistic study, culture]
---

In order to improve my verbal skills and oral English, I decide to start translating some original American series by scratch. Simpson's includes a lot of American jokes and memes, so it is a great target to my English study. The tranlate-study methodology origins from one of my favourite Youtuber and Linguist - Lele Farley, the idea which indicates that the key of learning language is repeating. Rather than just watch series episode by episode, digging deep into each liner of the specific episode will help me more. Here starts my work.
