- Gonzaga University, it's very small, buildings hides in a poor community, but somehow this school has one of the best sports teams in the country.

- East Washington is surprisingly red, very different from West state. A random gas station has a statue for General Washington.

- The climate here is also surprisingly different. There is desert, tumbleweed everywhere, some one worked for a fast food restuarant was cleaning the tumbleweed in the parking lot.
