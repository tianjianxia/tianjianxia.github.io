- Steptoe Butte State park, famous for the hill which present in Windows XP wallpaper

- The hill looks not like the one in the wallpaper at all, the photographer must wait for a long time to catch that shot. Rumors said Bill Gates paid a lot of money for the picture rights, which makes sense, he was WSU alumni.
