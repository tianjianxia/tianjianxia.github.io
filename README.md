- This is Tianjian Xia. This site is used to post my blogs about coding and sports stuff.

- After trying various blog solutions like React and Apache Roller, I am tired of migrating my articles and configurations between multiple resources. So I choose the static hosting service - GitHub Pages.

- Special thanks to [Tom Preston-Werner](https://tom.preston-werner.com/), the author of the template engine [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I made some minor modifications on the basis of Tom's blog template, and then added some features. Thank you Tom, Jekyll is a very easy-to-use site generator, and I love your minimalist blog template.
